PCSC Javascript  Bridge
=======================


== Introduction

This plugin is based on firebreath framework and is still under development.

Any reports, comments, request.... should be send to cedric.mesnil@ubinity.com


[float,,4]
Notation:


  - Javascript type are written between \{ \}, eg \{string\}, \{number\}
  - hex number value are written between ` ' , eg `1A' or `1a'
  - decimal number value are written as is, eg 10 
  - literal string are written between " "; eg "a string"
  - literal hexa string start with #, eg #1babe0

== Installing

For compilation, binary package and installation see the README file.


== Using

This current plugin is not a direct access to the standard PCSC APIs. 
It's more an object encapsulation of this APIs trying to simplify the card access and offering a minimal but easy ti use APIs.

The plugin offers two kind of object:

  - PCSCBridge
  - PCSCReader

PCSCBridge is the main entry point to the PCSC APIs.

PCSCReader give access to the reader and its inserted card.

[float,,4]
Note:

PCSCLib object is also under development and will provide an exact mapping to the PCSCLite API.

=== Initing the plugin

Before anything you must declare the plugin in your web page, load it, and initialize it in order to
establish the PCSC context and get the root bridge object.

The easiest way is to do that on the load page event:

--------
    <script type="text/javascript">
        var bridge;
        function load() {
            bridge =  document.getElementById('pcscbridge');
            bridge.init();
        }
    </script>  

    <body onload="load()">
        <object id="pcscbridge" type="application/x-pcscbridge" width="0" height="0">
            <param name="onload" value="pluginLoaded" />
        </object><br />

        <!-- INSERT HTML CODE -->

    </body>
--------

=== APIs

==== PCSCBridge APIs

The root PCSCBridge object offers the following APIs:

  - \{string[]\}  listReaders()
  - PCSCReader  selectReader(\{string\} prefix_reader_name)
  - \{string\}    strError(\{number\} errcode)

It also offer the following read only properties:

  - \{string\} version

  
===== Mehtod +listReaders+

Returns array of currently found readers. 


===== Mehtod +selectReader+

The select method build and return a new PCSCReader object. 
The select method does not try to connect to reader nor even check its existence.

The provided prefix reader name will used later, when trying to power up the reader. 
At this moment the first reader available and starting with this prefix will be selected.

===== Property +version+ 


The version of this plugin

==== PCSCReader APIs

Each  PCSCReader object offers the following APIs:

 - \{string\} powerUp()
 - void powerDown()
 - \{string\} transmit(\{string\} APDU)
 - \{string\} exchangeAPDU(\{string\} APDU, \{bool\} extended)

It also offers the following ReadWrite properties:
 - \{bool\}   autoReissue
 - \{bool\}   autoGetResponse
 - \{bool\}   autoChaining
 - \{number\} scardMode
 - \{bool\}   preferredProtocols
 - \{bool\}   extendedLengthSupported

and also offers the following ReadOnly properties:

 - atr
 - protocol
 - error
 - SW


Finally the following constant (ReadOnly) properties is also 
 - SCARD_SHARE_SHARED
 - SCARD_SHARE_EXCLUSIVE
 - SCARD_SHARE_DIRECT
 - SCARD_PROTOCOL_T0
 - SCARD_PROTOCOL_T1
 - SCARD_PROTOCOL_RAW


===== Mehtod +powerUp+

If the reader is already powered, the reader is first powered down. The SCardDisconnect function is called.

Then an existing reader with a name starting with the given prefix to the selectReader method is looked up. If found the reader is powerup (using SCardConnect) according the current value of _scardMode_, expecting a card is present, and the ATR is returned.

If card is succefully powered, the _ATR_ and _protocol_  properties are updated and the ATR is returned. 

If something goes wrong, the empty string is returned and the _error_ contains the last error code.


===== Mehtod +powerDown+

The reader is powered down, using SCardDisconnect function.

This method does not return anything, but _error_ should be checked.

===== Mehtod +transmit+

Send the given APDU (encoding as hexstring) to the card and return the card response as hexstring.

This method send the APDU exactly as provided and does not try to handle any protocol specific features.
Especially, the method does not automatique handle status word `61xx' and `6Cxx' and does not atomically reissue any command nor send any GET_REPONSE

===== Mehtod +exchangeAPDU+

Send the given APDU (encoding as hexstring) to the card and return the card response as hexstring.

This method tries to be smart and :

  - handle automatically reissue the command in case of `6Cxx' status word, if the _autoReissue_
    property is set to true
  - emit atomically a GET_REPONSE in case of `61xx' status word, if the _autoGetResponse_
    property is set to true
  - if the APDU is an extended one, and extended length is not supported 
    (_extendedLengthSupported_ set to false), this method try to automatically handle the T0
   chaining, if _autoChaining_ is set to true


===== Property +atr+

Contains ATR of last powerup, if card is still powered.

Empty string if there is no powered card.

=====  Property +protocol+

Contains currently used protocol:
 
 - 1 for T1
 - 0 for T0


=====  Property +error+

Contains last error code. A string description can be retrieved from _PCSCBridge.strError_ function.

=====  Property +SW+

Last APDU status word.

===== Property +extendedLengthSupported+

Behavior condition for exchangeAPDU method.
Tell if the application on the powered card support or not the extended APDU.

===== Property +autoReissue+

Behavior condition for exchangeAPDU method.

===== Property +autoGetResponse+

Behavior condition for exchangeAPDU method.

===== Property +autoChaining+

Behavior condition for exchangeAPDU method.

===== Property +scardMode+

Used by SCardConnect during _powerUp_ call. Possible values are:

 - PCSCReader.SCARD_SHARE_SHARED
 - PCSCReader.SCARD_SHARE_EXCLUSIVE
 - PCSCReader.SCARD_SHARE_DIRECT

===== Property +preferredProtocols+

Used by SCardConnect during _powerUp_ call. Possible values are:

 - PCSCReader.SCARD_PROTOCOL_T0
 - PCSCReader.SCARD_PROTOCOL_T1
 - PCSCReader.SCARD_PROTOCOL_RAW
